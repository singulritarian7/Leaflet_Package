# Leaflet_Package
## Experimenting with Leaflet package for visualization created by RStudio team.
The guys at RStudio are simply awesome! I will tell you 'why' in a  minute.  
I was recently browsing for a package to create maps without coding in JavaScript. I tried using **googleVis**, **rMaps**, **LeafletR**, and a lot of other packages that output map-images, until I came across this package called **Leaflet**. My favorite feature from the package- compatibility with RMarkdown- produces a great experience of seamless zoomable, interactive maps in an HTML which is quite portable.  
I get scared just writing HTML, JavaScript for me right now is far-far away! And then there was this package which now does not need me to leave my comfort zone (R-Rstudio) but still produces pretty-lookin' maps!  
Here is the project on Github: <https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet>  
I am thankful to their blog for a lot of code which appears on this page: <http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/#installation-and-use>  
**********
This repo is basically my attempts to create maps in by doing comfortable coding in R and minimal coding in JavaScript with the use of this great JS library called Leaflet.js

The markdown committed to this repo (.Rmd) file is by all means tweak-able and I will be more than happy to answer any questions as long as I can answer them!

Thanks for visiting this page.
